The tools can also be limiting and do not adapt well as technologies and trends change. This is a growing dilemma of sustainability and maintenance for IDs and EDs on instructional products. The authoring tool becomes an impediment. An alternative approach is to launch components in the same internal environment without the tool using Bootstrap, CSS, and JS.
